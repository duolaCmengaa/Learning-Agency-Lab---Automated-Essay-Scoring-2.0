Car-free cities,"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars",Elisabeth Rosenthal,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/12/science/earth/12suburb.html,"Vauban, an experimental district near Freiburg, Germany, is pioneering suburban living without reliance on cars. Established in 2006, it prohibits street parking, driveways, and home garages, allowing car ownership but limiting parking to large garages on the development's edge, costing $40,000 per space. This innovative concept has led 70% of Vauban’s families to live without cars, with 57% selling their cars to move there. Emphasizing “smart planning,” Vauban is a model in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, a critical factor in combating global warming. The district, home to 5,500 residents, showcases how suburban areas can be more compact, accessible to public transportation, and less car-dependent. This approach aligns with efforts in the U.S. and Europe to develop suburbs that favor public transport and walking, with amenities within walking distance. However, despite these efforts, challenges remain in changing car-centric attitudes and adapting urban planning regulations to support such sustainable living models."
Car-free cities,Paris bans driving due to smog,Robert Duffer,https://scoringguides.cambiumast.com/pdfs/Grade_10.pdf,"Paris faced severe pollution, prompting a partial driving ban. Motorists with even-numbered plates were barred on Monday, facing a 22-euro fine, with odd-numbered plates targeted the next day. Nearly 4,000 fines were issued, and 27 cars were impounded. This action reduced congestion by 60 percent, addressing smog levels comparable to Beijing. The smog, intensified by weather conditions, was partly blamed on diesel vehicles, which are prevalent in France due to tax policies. Paris generally experiences more smog than other European capitals, with significantly higher particulate matter levels than cities like Brussels or London. The driving restrictions led to complaints from delivery companies but exceptions were made for eco-friendly and high-occupancy vehicles. Public transport was free from Friday to Monday. The improved air quality by Monday led to the lifting of the ban for Tuesday."
Car-free cities,Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,Andrew Selsky,https://scoringguides.cambiumast.com/pdfs/Grade_10.pdf,"In Bogotá, Colombia, a successful ""Day Without Cars"" was observed for the third consecutive year, aimed at encouraging alternative transport and reducing air pollution. This initiative, where millions left their cars at home and opted for hiking, biking, skating, or public transportation, has become a remarkable event in this city of 7 million. Despite occasional rain, participation was high, with fines for violations set at $25. Bogotá Mayor Antanas Mockus highlighted the event's significance in reducing stress and air pollution. This year, for the first time, the Colombian cities of Cali and Valledupar also participated, drawing interest from international municipal authorities, like Enrique Riera, mayor of Asunción, Paraguay, who praised the initiative's revolutionary impact.

This car-free day is part of a broader urban improvement campaign started in the mid-1990s in Bogotá. The city has constructed 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most in Latin America, and has seen significant urban developments, including new parks, sports centers, improved sidewalks, reduced rush-hour traffic, and burgeoning restaurant and shopping districts, transforming the cityscape and lifestyle in Bogotá."
Car-free cities,The end of car culture,Elisabeth Rosenthal,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/30/sunday-review/the-end-of-car-culture.html,"President Obama's goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions align with a trend in American behavior: declining car ownership and usage. Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less, with a significant drop in miles driven per person since 2005. This shift precedes the economic downturn and continues despite recovery, suggesting a deeper cultural change. Societal factors like internet-based work and socializing, urban revitalization, and evolving commuting habits are contributing to this trend. This reduction in driving impacts carbon emissions positively but poses challenges for the automobile industry. Companies are adapting by expanding into broader mobility services. Demographic changes, especially among younger generations who prioritize technology over car ownership, are accelerating this shift. The long-term impact on car culture and industry remains uncertain, with implications for urban planning and sustainability."
Does the electoral college work?,What is the Electoral College?,The Office of the Federal Register,https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/about,"The Electoral College, established in the U.S. Constitution by the Founding Fathers, is a process for electing the President and Vice President, involving a combination of Congressional voting and popular vote. It includes 538 electors, with a majority of 270 needed for election. States have electors equal to their Congressional representation, and the District of Columbia is treated as a state with 3 electors. Electors, typically selected by political parties, vote in December after the general election, where voters choose preferred electors. Most states use a winner-takes-all system, except Maine and Nebraska which use proportional representation. The electoral votes are counted in a joint Congress session on January 6th, and the President-elect is sworn in on January 20th following the general election."
Does the electoral college work?,The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,Bradford Plumer,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2004/10/indefensible-electoral-college/,"The electoral college, a system where voters select electors who then elect the president, has faced criticism for its potential to cause confusion and for not always reflecting the popular vote, as seen in the 2000 election. Critics, including prominent figures and organizations, argue that it is outdated, unfair, and can lead to disasters like faithless electors or a tie in electoral votes, which would throw the election to Congress. Proponents often cite reasons such as protection of state interests and federalism, but these defenses are increasingly seen as inadequate. The system's origins, tied to concessions to slaveholders and assumptions about public information access, are no longer relevant. Direct elections, despite concerns about recounts and third-party candidates, are argued to be a more equitable and straightforward method, reflecting the popular will more accurately. The consensus among critics is clear: it's time to abolish the electoral college."
Does the electoral college work?,In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,Richard A. Posner,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2012/11/defending-the-electoral-college.html,"The Electoral College, often criticized as an outdated, non-democratic system for electing a president, remains in place despite arguments favoring the popular vote winner. It functions by allocating electors based on state representation in Congress, with almost all states using a winner-take-all approach. This system can lead to discrepancies between the national popular vote and the electoral vote, as seen in the 2000 election. However, there are practical reasons for retaining the Electoral College: it ensures certainty of outcome, requires candidates to have broad, transregional appeal, focuses attention on swing states, balances the influence of large states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. Despite critiques of its undemocratic nature, the Electoral College is seen as a stabilizing factor in the representative democratic process of the United States, outweighing the potential negative impacts such as voter disenfranchisement in states dominated by a single party."

The Face on Mars,Unmasking the Face on Mars,Dr Tony Phillips,https://www.firstscience.com/SITE/ARTICLES/face.asp,"Twenty-five years ago, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft captured a photo of a face-like Martian mesa in Cydonia, sparking intrigue. Initially thought to be an unusual rock formation, it gained pop culture fame, appearing in films and media, fueling conspiracy theories about life on Mars. NASA prioritized photographing Cydonia with the Mars Global Surveyor in 1997. Images revealed it as a natural landform, akin to Earth's buttes or mesas, disappointing alien life proponents. Laser altimetry confirmed its natural origins, similar to other Cydonian mesas. Cydonia's geological interest lies in its location at a potential ancient Martian ocean boundary, raising questions about Mars' past."

He joined the UNRRA (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) as a seagoing cowboy, delivering animals to war-torn Europe. He and his friend Don embarked on their first mission to Greece, caring for 335 horses. Luke turned 18 en route, qualifying his service as his military draft duty. Over two years, he completed nine trips, more than any other seagoing cowboy, experiencing Europe and China. Despite dangers like nearly falling overboard, Luke also enjoyed on-board leisure activities. This unique experience significantly broadened his worldview and influenced his later life, including hosting international students and exchange visitors."
